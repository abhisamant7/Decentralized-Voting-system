# Decentralized-Voting-system
# Decentralized P2P Voting App --- ##### **The voting system in India as well as in some countries abroad is flawed and can be easily manipulated and hampered by those with power to suit their personal benefits. It allows people with money to buy the votes or tamper the machine that record it. A current example can be the recent elections in Uttar Pradesh where the ruling party manipulated the voting machines to gain unfair advantage.** #####  #### Solution ####  A voting system which is unhackable or which cannot be tampered. Using blockchain based distributed networks to store and record votes which allows voting to be almost 99.9% secure as it is distributed among a cluster of networks and requires computing power of over 500 supercomputers to even get hold of the network which is currently impossible to achieve. The system has a user friendly interface and can be used to run polls and elections with total security and zero percent chance of manipulation.  ## Advantages :customs: * It is totally on a peer to peer network so virtually impossible for a person to hack or get hold on a network. * A person cannot vote more than once. * A distributed system means no tampering or manupulating.:bookmark_tabs:  ## Security Aspect We are using blockchain technology as the backbone of our product. Because of blockchain, the data (of the voting) canâ€™t be tampered or manipulated as it is distributed over the network. We used ganache which is a tool that collects a small percentage of test ether every time a person votes verifying the identity of the person and we also used solidity test cases to verify if the candidates and the voter is valid.    ## Technologies Used:computer: * Ethereum * Truffle * Ganache-cli * Vue Js (Client side) * Webpack * Solidity * TestRPC * NPM/Yarn
